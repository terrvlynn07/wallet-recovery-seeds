⚠️ **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen is designed to generate wallets. It utilizes [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin. For Ethereum and other EVM-based chains, it relies on [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing.

The software compares generated addresses against known databases, as well as checks balances in real-time via blockchain explorers.

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source.

##  Why WalletGen?

**WalletGen** is optimized for performance. Written in C++ and designed for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, it delivers impressive performance.

## Features

-   **Cryptocurrency Wallet Generation:** Generates wallets.
-   **Balance Search (Brute Force):** It uses brute-force techniques to find wallets.
-   **Algorithm Support:** Supports relevant algorithms.
-   **Database Integration:** Uses databases to speed up searches.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** enables brute-force search for crypto wallets with balances.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Select option 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets via the internet.
*   Select option 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets via the internet.
*   Press key 6 to search EVM wallets using the database.

## The Program Found a Wallet — What’s Next?

When the program finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search immediately stops.
*   The wallet details are displayed.
*   The data is saved.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the located wallet into a compatible crypto wallet.
2.  You can then transfer the funds.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen enables you to recover your Bitcoin wallet by seed phrase.

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

Replace missing words with *.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed.

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol to search for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words may take considerable time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program and saves data.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/upload/map.webp)

I’ve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here’s the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
